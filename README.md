## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS OF MOVIE REVIEWS USING RECURRENT NEURAL NETWORKS


## Project Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on IMDB dataset of movie reviews to classify each review as positive or negative. The model is built using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), leveraging their ability to understand sequential data. The aim is to accurately predict the sentiment of each review, which is valuable for applications in recommendation systems, social media analysis, and feedback evaluation.

## Features
- **Dataset:** Collection of labeled movie reviews (positive or negative).
- **Model:** RNN model for text classification using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Preprocessing:** One_Hot representation,  and padding.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix for performance evaluation.

## Requirements
To run this project, you need the following libraries:
- Python 3.11.0
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

Install the dependencies by running:
pip install -r requirements.txt in the command terminal of IDE
